     <h3>New Year</h3>

     <div class="messageBox hidden">
     <p class="message-text">
      Happy New Year, my love.<br>

      Before anything else, I want to begin with how deeply I love you. You are my first love in the sense of conscious love, and you will also be my last. I am no longer the same person who believed in love only through its freshness, who trusted everything with pure hope and relentless optimism. That brightness from the past can never truly return, and it doesn’t need to. Because what I have found now is something far more precious. It’s a love that understands the value of safety.  With you, love is no longer a battlefield. I don’t have to stay tense, to guess your moods, or to measure every word I speak. Being with you feels like being allowed to breathe.
      <br>

      Thank you for everything. When I say everything, I truly mean it. You are the most precious gift the universe has ever sent my way. Even though we have only known each other for a single month, it feels as though our souls have been acquainted far longer than time can explain. I want to be honest with you. In the beginning, I was scared. I worried that everything was moving too fast. I questioned whether this was love bombing, whether we would truly be compatible, whether we opened our hearts too quickly, or whether we should have been friends first. I even wondered if I should leave room to talk to others, just in case.
      But I didn’t. The idea of talking to multiple people at once has never felt right to me. Even before we officially became a couple, I could never divide my attention or my heart that way. And the more I came to know you, the more confident I became in this love.
      <br>

      There are countless things I want to thank you for, but there is one I want to thank you for in particular. It’s everything you have done for me in the game. Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Especially for the time, patience, and care you poured into breeding all those animals for me. I know it isn’t easy. It takes effort, observation, waiting, skill, and an incredible amount of dedication. Even though I’ve never bred animals myself, I understand how much work it requires. This wasn’t something you did lightly, it was real commitment.
      <br>

      What touches me most is that you didn’t do these things because I asked you to. You did them because you wanted to make me happy. You chose, on your own, to give me something meaningful. Through that, I felt genuinely loved and cared for. You turned something small in a game into something enormous in my heart. Though truly, it wasn’t small at all, because no one could have done it the way you did. It wasn’t just a game anymore. It became a memory, a bond, something we built together.
      <br>

      And then there was the incident with the fawn I accidentally dropped and lost. I was so stressed that I couldn’t bring myself to tell you for thirty whole minutes. I was afraid you would scold me. Or even if you didn’t, that you might feel heartbroken over the time and effort you had invested, all disappearing because of my carelessness. That day, my period had started too, and my emotions were already overwhelming. I told you I wouldn’t cry, but I did shortly after.
      <br>

      I didn’t even have the courage to say it out loud. I had to gather all my bravery just to type it to you. Yet you never blamed me. You only comforted me. In that moment, I felt so clearly how much you cared, how ready you were to stand beside me, no matter how small or big the situation was. And I need you to know this honestly… That was the day I fell completely in love with you. Before that, I had only stepped in with one foot. That day, I fell in with my whole heart.
      <br>

      Because of that, I wanted to give something back to you. Even though you say I’ve already given you so much, I realized I had never truly given you a tangible gift. That was how the website came to be. It wasn’t the first time I had devoted myself to someone I loved. But it was the first time I did so as a lover, without trying to prove my worth, without pushing myself in fear of being unseen. I didn’t create it to prove my love. I created it because I wanted to. You never asked me to. It came entirely from my heart.
      <br>

      And I didn’t stop at making it just a Christmas gift. I continued to improve it, because I wanted to build a space that truly belongs to us. This was the first time in my life that I built an entire path by myself. Without prior knowledge, without tutorials, and without guides. I learned, failed, fixed, and tried again until it took shape. It wasn’t just dedication. It was a belief in my own potential that I had never felt before. And I am proud of that.
      <br><br>

      Now, after such a long prelude, let me move on to my wishes for you... I’m so happy that I now have one more person I want to say goodbye to the year with. And that person is also the one I want to welcome every year with, from now on. As you said, we have many years ahead of us to celebrate together. But this is our first year, and I wanted it to be a little special. Though truly, every day with you already is. Whether it’s an ordinary day or a holiday.
      <br>

      I wish this new year brings you endless happiness and smiles every single day. And if I can be even one of the reasons behind that beautiful smile, it would be my greatest honor. I hope this will be a year where we grow together, where the dreams we share slowly come true, and where every day is filled with our love. 
      Alongside the love of your family and everyone you care deeply about. I wish them all nothing but good things, not just for the coming year, but for many years beyond. May they all stay healthy and strong, living long lives beside us. I believe they will, because you take such good care of the people around you.
      <br>

      As for your studies, I hope everything goes according to your hopes. But please don’t be too hard on yourself. You are already incredibly capable and dedicated. You will reach your goals in time. And if something doesn’t go as planned, believe that an even greater success may be waiting ahead. Most importantly, please live happily. It’s okay to feel angry, frustrated, or upset. You are never wrong for feeling what you feel. Always prioritize your own well-being first. When your heart begins to settle, good things will follow naturally. Even if the world isn’t always kind to us, it’s enough that we are kind to ourselves. And just so you know. You are incredibly precious to me. My premium, gold-coated potato, and the cutest one of all.
      <br>

      There is still so much more I want to say, but these are the words I wanted you to hear most. I love you deeply. Even though our bodies may be far apart, our hearts are tightly bound, as if intertwined. I hope this last day of the year is filled with joy, good food, precious moments, and the warmth of being loved. May these twenty-four hours carve themselves gently and beautifully into your memory.
      <br>

      I love you so dearly, my moonbeam ⏾
